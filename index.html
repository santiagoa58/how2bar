        <!--Tequila-->
        <ul class="types" onclick="showSpirits(0)"><span class="bold">Tequila</span> <span class="arrow">&#8250;</span>
            <li>Tequila was first produced in the 16th century and can only be made from 5 Mexican states, primarily in the area surrounding the city of Tequila and the Mexican state of Jalisco. &nbsp;All tequila is distilled from blue weber agave and must be made by law from at least 51% agave, with premium Tequila being 100% blue agave. &nbsp; </li>
            <li>The aging of Tequila takes place in oak containers, typically used bourbon casks. &nbsp; With the exception of gold tequila, it is the duration of the aging that differentiates the different types of Tequila:
            </li>
            <li class="indent"><span class="emphasis">Gold</span> - typically gold tequilas are not aged and instead get their gold color from added caramel coloring and sugar. &nbsp; Some 100% agave gold tequilas are made from the combination of silver and aged tequila.</li>
            <li class="indent"><span class="emphasis">Blanco</span> - also called silver, blanco tequila is aged for less than two months and is clear.</li>
            <li class="indent"><span class="emphasis">Reposado</span> - this tequila is aged between two and 12 months and is a golden color.</li>
            <li class="indent"><span class="emphasis">Añejo</span> - añejo tequila is aged between one to three years and is a brown color resembling that of whisky.</li>
            <li class="indent"><span class="emphasis">Extra Añejo</span> - a new category introduced by the Tequila Regulatory Council in 2006 and is aged for more than three years.</li>
        </ul>

        <!--Mezcal-->
        <ul class="types" onclick="showSpirits(1)"><span class="bold">Mezcal</span> <span class="arrow">&#8250;</span>
            <li>Mezcal, also spelled mescal, is a Mexican spirit that is distilled from the agave plant. &nbsp;Technically speaking, tequila is a mezcal, however, mezcal can be distilled from different types of agave, not just blue weber agave like tequila, and at a minimum of 80% agave. &nbsp;Furthermore, tequila can only be made in 5 Mexican states whereas mezcal can be produced in most Mexican states, namely Oaxaca, Durango, Guanajuato, Guerrero, San Luis Potosi, Zacatecas, Tamaulipas, Michoacan, and Puebla. &nbsp;Mezcal and tequila also differ in their production process, but share the aging classifications.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <!--Gin-->
        <ul class="types" onclick="showSpirits(2)"><span class="bold">Gin</span> <span class="arrow">&#8250;</span>
            <li>Gin is a flavored spirit made by distilling grains like barley, rye or corn. &nbsp; It is alcohol infused with juniper berries and a variety of other botanicals. &nbsp; These botanicals can include a wide array of herbs, vegetables, flowers, fruits, spices and even tea.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <!--Vodka-->
        <ul class="types" onclick="showSpirits(3)"><span class="bold">Vodka</span> <span class="arrow">&#8250;</span>
            <li>Vodka can be made anywhere in the world and is traditionally made from potatoes, corn or grains, but it can also be made from a wide range of bases like grapes and maple syrup. &nbsp; There is no universal rule that dictates how the spirit should be produced, but the final product should be colorless, odorless and tasteless, although a number of distillers do leave some flavor.</li>
        </ul>

        <!--Rum-->
        <ul class="types" onclick="showSpirits(4)"><span class="bold">Rum</span> <span class="arrow">&#8250;</span>
            <li>Rum is distilled from sugar cane, or more specifically from its byproduct molasses or sugar cane juice, and water. &nbsp;Like vodka, rum can be produced anywhere in the world, but the majority comes from the Caribbean and Latin America. &nbsp;There are two main types of Rum: light rum and dark rum. &nbsp; However, there is also spiced rum and golden rum.</li>
            <li class="indent"><span class="emphasis">Light</span> - also called silver or white, is aged in oak barrels for a year or more and then filtered, with charcoal, to remove any color picked up from the barrel.</li>
            <li class="indent"><span class="emphasis">Golden</span> - aged for several years in oak barrels, golden rum is midway between light and dark rum. &nbsp; The longer time spent aging gives the rum more color and flavor from the wood.</li>
            <li class="indent"><span class="emphasis">Dark</span> - often aged the longest, dark rums, as the name suggests, are darker than golden rums. &nbsp; Sometimes added caramel is what gives dark rum its rich and heavier style and not a longer aging process. &nbsp; They are usually aged in heavily charred barrels which results in a stronger flavor than that of its lighter counterparts.</li>
            <li class="indent"><span class="emphasis">Spiced</span> - can be light, golden, or dark rums. &nbsp; Spiced rums gain their flavor from vanilla, spices, or artificial flavors. &nbsp;Some of the spices added include cinnamon, rosemary, aniseed, or pepper.</li>
        </ul>

        <!--Brandy-->
        <ul class="types" onclick="showSpirits(5)"><span class="bold">Brandy</span> <span class="arrow">&#8250;</span>
            <li>Brandy is a spirit produced by distilling wine and it usually contains 35% to 60% alcohol by volume. &nbsp;<i>Brandy</i> also refers to eaux-de-vie or liquors obtained form the wines of other fruits like apples, cherries, plums, and pears. &nbsp;Pomace brandy is also quite common and is distilled from pomace, the skin, stems, and seeds, that are left over from winemaking. &nbsp;</li>
            <li>Brandy is normally rated by how long it has been aged, which usually occurs in wooden casks. &nbsp; Aging can also be imitated with the addition of caramel coloring. &nbsp;The ratings vary by country and is generally unregulated in the US, however the most common ratings are:</li>
            <li class="indent"><span class="emphasis">3 star or VS</span> - Very Special brandy is aged for at least 2 years, this younger type of brandy is what is usually mixed into cocktails.</li>
            <li class="indent"><span class="emphasis">VSOP</span> - Very Special Old Pale is aged for at least four or five years.</li>
            <li class="indent"><span class="emphasis">XO</span> - Extra Old brandy is aged for six and a half years or more.</li>
            <li class="indent"><span class="emphasis">Hors d’age or Vintage</span> - are aged for the longest, more than ten years. &nbsp; Vintage brandies will have the year of harvest on the bottle while hors d'age will not. &nbsp;</li>
        </ul>

        <!--Cognac-->
        <ul class="types" onclick="showSpirits(6)"><span class="bold">Cognac</span> <span class="arrow">&#8250;</span>
            <li>Cognac is the most famous variety of brandy and it must be produced in the Cognac region of France. &nbsp;It is double distilled using copper pot stills which produces a colorless alcohol called eau-de-vie (literally water of life). &nbsp; Cognac, being a variety of brandy, follows the same general categories of VS, VSOP, and XO.</li>
        </ul>

    <article class="container-black">
        <h2 class="emphasis" id="whisky">Whisk(e)y</h2>
        <section class="indent">
            <p>Whisk(e)y is spelled with the <i>e</i> (whiskey) if it is from Ireland or the US and is spelled without the <i>e</i> (whisky) if it is made elsewhere. &nbsp; Whiskey, or whisky, is alcohol distilled to a minimum of 40% and maximum of 94.8% alchohol by volume (ABV) and largely from fermented grain mash, which is a base mixture of grain and water. &nbsp;Whiskey is typically aged in casks made of charred white oak with different grains like barley, corn, rye, and wheat being used for different whiskey varieties. &nbsp;The type of whiskey can be distinguished by its country of origin and the type of grain used in the distillation process. &nbsp;The types of whiskey include, but are not limited to, rye whiskey, bourbon whiskey, scotch whisky, Irish whiskey, and Canadian whisky. &nbsp;Types of whiskey can also be categorized as being malt, grain, corn, or blended.</p>
            <br/>
            <h3>Scotch</h3>
            <p>Scotch whisky is whisky made entirely in Scotland and must be made from water and malted barley, but whole grains of other cereals may also be added. &nbsp;The malted barley is often dried over peat smoke, which gives scotch its smoky flavor. &nbsp;Scotch must also be aged in oak casks for at least three years and one day in Scotland and is generally distilled twice in pot stills, but a few are distilled three times. &nbsp;</p>
            <br/>
            <h3>Irish</h3>
            <p>Irish whiskey is typically distilled three times and must be produced in Ireland and be aged for at least three years in wooden casks. &nbsp;Similar to scotch, Irish whiskey must include malted barley and may include other unmalted cereal grains. &nbsp;Furthermore, Irish whiskey is often made from kiln-dried barley, which gives it a smoother taste than the smoky overtones that are common in some scotches. &nbsp; </p>
            <br/>
            <h3>Canadian</h3>
            <p>Canadian whisky is often referred to as rye whisky, even though there are no requirements for rye to be used in the distillation process. &nbsp;Canadians use a variety of mash bills, a combination of grains in different proportions, and most of their whiskies are blended after maturation with multi-grain liquors that contain a large percentage of corn spirits. &nbsp;historicaly, highly flavored rye grain was added to the mash and people began calling this new style of rye-flavored whisky as rye in order to distinguish it from other whiskeys like bourbon. &nbsp;Today, Canadian law requires that whisky labeled as <i>Canadian Whisky</i>, <i>Canadian Rye Whisky</i>, or <i>Rye Whisky</i> be aged for at least three years in Canada and any spirit used in the making of Canadian whisky must be aged in wooden barrels, used or new, with a capacity of 700L or less.</p>
            <br/>
            <h3>Bourbon & American</h3>
            <p>Bourbon is an American whiskey distilled from a mash that is at least 51% corn and its name comes from the geographic area known as Old Bourbon in Kentucky. &nbsp;As an American whiskey, it must be aged in new charred oak barrels and must be distilled to a maximum of 80% ABV (160 proof). &nbsp;Other American whiskeys include rye, rye malt, malt, wheat, corn, and Tennessee whiskey, which has almost identical requirements to bourbon, but must be made in Tennessee and be charcoal-filtered before it is filled into casks. &nbsp;<strong>Straight bourbon</strong> must be aged in the new oak barrels for at least two years and be made from a single batch. &nbsp;It must be unblended and, essentially, be <i>straight</i> from the barrel.</p>
            <br/>
            <h3>Rye</h3>
            <p>Rye whiskey can refer to either American rye whiskey or Canadian whisky. &nbsp; American rye whiskey contains at least 51% rye and must be aged in oak casks for at least two years. &nbsp;Since American law calls for several requirements in order to label a product as rye whiskey, the vast majority of Canadian rye whiskies cannot be sold in the United States as rye whisky.</p>
            <br/>
            <h3>Corn</h3>
            <p>Corn whiskey is an American liquor produced from mash that is no less than 80% corn. &nbsp; Unlike other American whiskeys, corn whiskey does not need to be aged. &nbsp; If it is aged, it's typically for 6 months or less and it must be in used or uncharred oak barrels.</p>
            <br/>
            <h3>Malt</h3>
            <p>Malt whisky is made predominantly in Scotland and from mash primarily consisting of a malted grain, presumably barley. &nbsp;It is distilled twice in pot stills and can be called <strong>single malt whisky</strong> if produced exclusively at a single distillery that only used a single malted grain. &nbsp;Furthermore, in Scotland or Ireland, for a whisky to be considered malt whisky, it must be made from mash consisting of 100% malted barley.</p>
            <br/>
            <h3>Grain</h3>
            <p>Grain whiskey is made mainly from corn and barley, but can also contain wheat or rye and not include barley. &nbsp;Similar to single malt whisky, <strong>single-grain whiskies</strong> are made from a single distillery, but with the addition of other cereal grains, typically wheat, corn or a blend, instead of just malted barley.</p>
            <br/>
            <h3>Blended</h3>
            <p>Blended whisky, or blended whiskey, is made by combining different types of whiskies from different distilleries. &nbsp;Typically, blended whisky contains a blend of barrel aged malt whisky and grain whiskies. &nbsp; However, there are also <strong>blended malt whisky</strong> and <strong>blended grain whisky</strong>, which is the combination of single malt whiskies and single grain whiskies, respectively, from different distilleries.</p>
